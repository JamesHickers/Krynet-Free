    <p>Krynet Privacy Policy
Effective Date: [Insert Date]

Krynet is committed to providing a fast, secure, and privacy-respecting communication platform. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your privacy while ensuring compliance with applicable laws.

1. Introduction
Krynet provides a privacy-focused, instant chat platform with AI-powered features for enhanced user experiences. By using Krynet, you agree to this Privacy Policy. We take your privacy seriously and aim to maintain a secure environment.

2. Data We Collect
Account Information:
When you sign up for Krynet, we collect your email address, username, and password (hashed for security).

Personal Information (PII):
In some cases, we may require age verification, and for this, you may be asked to provide a government-issued ID to confirm your age (18+ or legal age of use). This data will only be used for verification and will be stored securely for up to one year.

Usage Data:
This includes details like your activity on the platform (messages, uploads, interactions) and metadata generated during usage.

Device Information:
Device type, operating system, and IP address for security and troubleshooting.

3. How We Use Your Data
To Provide Services:
We use your data to maintain and improve Krynet, deliver features, and provide support.

To Verify Age:
Your ID may be stored for up to one year for age verification purposes, confirming that you are 18+ or the legal age required by the platform.

To Improve the User Experience:
Data is used to improve features, enhance security, and monitor platform performance.

For Legal Compliance:
In the event of criminal activity or legal requirements, we may store and provide evidence to government authorities as required by law.

4. Law Enforcement & Legal Requests
We respect your privacy, but in compliance with applicable laws:

If a government entity (FBI, CIA, etc.) presents a valid warrant or reasonable legal cause related to criminal activity, we may be required to provide your personally identifiable information (PII).

Evidence linking you to a crime may be stored and presented in court if necessary, as required by law.

Data related to criminal activity may be shared with law enforcement authorities when mandated by law.

5. Data Retention
General Data:
Your personal and usage data is retained only as long as necessary for providing services and legal compliance.

Age Verification Data:
Government-issued ID for age verification is stored securely for up to one year and will be deleted once the verification process is complete.

6. Age Requirements
Krynet is for users 16 and up.
Users under 16 will:

Have limited features.

Be subject to parental monitoring tools.

Be removed if policy is bypassed.

Age Verification: To confirm that you are 18+ or of legal age, we may collect and store a government-issued ID for up to one year for age verification purposes. This information will not be sold or shared and will be securely stored and deleted after the verification period.

7. Data Security & Encryption
We employ state-of-the-art security measures to protect your data:

End-to-End Encryption: All communications (DMs, media, account details) are encrypted.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For enhanced account security.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Available for additional protection.

Latest Encryption Tools & Data Privacy Protocols: We stay up to date with the latest advancements in data security and privacy to protect against emerging threats.

Automatic Deletion of Dangerous Uploads: We perform AI-driven scanning of uploads to prevent malicious content.

No Third-Party Analytics or Profiling Tools: We do not use third-party tracking or profiling on the platform.

8. AI Moderation & Content Review
Krynet utilizes an AI-powered moderation engine to automatically scan content for inappropriate or illegal material.

Moderators may have limited access to DMs and other content for reviewing flagged items to ensure safety and avoid false bans.

No Data for Sale: Despite using AI systems for moderation, all data is never sold or shared for non-compliance purposes.

9. Your Rights & Choices
Data Access & Deletion: You have the right to access your personal data and request its deletion at any time.

Opt-Out of Communications: You can opt-out of non-essential communications or marketing messages by adjusting your settings.

Account Deletion: You may delete your account at any time. Upon deletion, we will erase all personal data stored on the platform within a reasonable time frame, except where legally required to retain it.

10. Privacy of Children
Krynet is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove it.

11. Third-Party Services
Krynet does not share your data with third-party advertisers or analytics services. The platform may integrate services like Spotify or Steam for enhanced functionality, but your data is not used for profiling or targeted advertising.

12. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through notifications on the platform or by email. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
